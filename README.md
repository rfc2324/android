Coffee Android Application

## Contribute
If you want to contribute by adding code for several coffee machines, you have to follow these steps:

1. Create the machine type in the setting's ```pref_machines``` array
2. Create the function for your machine (I use brew and the name. Example: ```brewtoast```)
3. Call your function in the ```onClick``` function in the *MainActivity.java*

Then you can create a pull request with your code. Don't forget a proper description of what you've added.
